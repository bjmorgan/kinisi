    "The aim of investigating the mean-squared displacements as a function of timestep is to fit a straight line and therefore obtain a estimate of the infinite timescale diffusion coefficient. \n",
    "This might seem like a straight forward concept, however, for a real simulation, with a limited number of atoms and simulation length, the observed value of the diffusion coefficient will vary upon repetition of a given simulation.\n",
    "`kinisi` is a Python library that is capable of: \n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li> Accurately estimating the infinite timescale diffusion coefficient from a single simulation</li>\n",
    "<li> Quantifying the variance in the diffusion coefficient that would be observed on repetition of the simulation</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to achieve this, it is neccessary to build up a complete picture of the observed diffusion from the simulation and use this information to apply the approach with the highest [statistical efficiency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficiency_(statistics)) to estimate the diffusion coefficient. \n",
    "The different approach that can be taken to estimate this are shown in the schematic below, which we will work through below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, that this is **not** aimed to show how `kinisi` should be run but rather to outline the methodology that `kinisi` uses.\n",
    "Examples of how to run `kinisi` from the API can be found in the [notebooks](./notebooks.md). \n",
